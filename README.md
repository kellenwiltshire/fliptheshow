## Lessons Learned

The site was designed with NextJS and TailwindCSS. The site was a good lesson on how to format tables with lots of information to look good on multiple screen sizes.

Unfortunately, the Players section is currently broken due a change in information relayed by API and I have had a chance to fix it yet...
